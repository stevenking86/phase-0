Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

  Log into your GitHub account using the username and password you created when you signed up. 

  Towards the top of the right side of your screen, click on the green "+ New repository" button. 

  Fill in some basic information and be sure to select "MIT License" and create your repository.

  Towards the middle of your screen on the right side you'll see "HTTPS clone URL".  Copy that. 

  Click the magnifying glass on the top righthand side of your computer and find your terminal. 

  Type "git clone" and paste your URL.  Be sure to leave a space between the word "clone" and your URL. 

  You did it! 

Describe what open source means.

Open source means the project, code, or documents may be freely used, modified or shared.  There are different degrees to how "open source" something can be based on which license it falls under. 

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

It makes me happy.  I like the idea that an open source culture exists amongst programmers.  It seems like GitHub is almost the Public Library of the internet age.  Like, why wouldn't we want to share the knowledge? If people are working on the same problems as someone else, open source allows them to work together or to piggy back off of what the previous person has done.  That way people can move onto the next challenge more quickly.  It can be an accelerated process rather than two parallel processes.  And it's not like 100% of things are open source so if there's a reason to protect code, it's possible. 

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses seem to fine tune the degree to which something is "open".  Can it be sold? Under which circumstances? Can it be copied, edited, and distributed. How can it be distributed? Licenses are important because they help address these finer points. 

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I did have an "aha" moment! On the previous challenge I was getting an error message when I did git status telling me that my master was somehow "behind".  I was planning to ask about it in office hours or perhaps message my teacher but I thought perhaps the solution would present itself in this challenge.  It did.  As I went through this time, I realized I'd forgotten the last couple steps of the git process.  I hadn't done "git fetch origin master" or "git merge origin/master".  Now I know! 

One thing that's not necessarily a struggle, but it's something I want to figure out is using the command "subl" to open sublime files from the command line.  I know that some of my cohort-mates are discussing it in the chat so I may try to figure it out next. Right now I'm just using the mouse for this. 

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I made some notes on one of the first git videos we had to watch.  That was actually what helped me through the git process the most.  

I also clicked around opensource.org a bit just out of interest. There is an outrageous number of licenses.
