#1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I read through several of the articles and read some videos and decided to focus on "flow".  I think it's the subject I know the least about of the choices and I figured it would be best to select a topic where I didn't have a bunch of preconceived ideas! Though I was familiar with flow, I got a more concrete understand of what exactly it is, how to get into it, and why it's great. It was neat to see how mindfulness training and meditation are sort of like going to the gym, but for helping someone get into the flow state.

Time Boxing is setting up a fixed time period for each activity.  This can be general, like how in this challenge we were told to spend no more than an hour total, or more focused like using the pomodoro technique.  It involves deliberate deadlines, which hopefully increases productivity.  A key feature is to review progress at the end of each timebox. 

My plan for phase 0 is to continue my current time management technique.  I've worked remote for the past four years so I've had a chance to figure out what works and what doesn't.  I use more generalized time boxes (things like: work for an hour, take a ten minute break).  I plan to implement the timebox idea of reviewing progress at the end of each work period. 

And though I've dabbled before, I plan to make a focused effort to meditate for a few minutes each day.  This will increase my ability to stay on task and also increase the likelihood of me reaching a flow state while working.   

#1.2 The Command Line Reflection

1. A shell is a way to interact with the operating system.  Bash, is the particular terminal and command line that we're working with. 

2. The most challenging thing for me was understanding exactly what I'm looking at when I type in the env command! Though I can grasp a few of the things I see there, I'm definitely unfamiliar with a lot of what I'm looking at. 

3. I was able to successfully use the commands in the Crash Course.  

4. Honestly I'm not sure what will end up being most important.  I think once I start regularly using the command line as I'm doing projects I'll see what's important.  I would guess the most basic, foundational things are most important though: "cd" and "ls" because that's how to get around and know what you've got to work with.  And it seems to be what I typed the most!

5. pwd - prints working directory -- tells me where I am.

ls - lists the contents of the directory I'm in

mv - abbreviation for "move" but really is more like renaming

cd - "change directory" - used to move around to different directories

../ - I'm not sure about this one off the top of my head.

touch - makes an empty file

mkdir - makes a directory

less - used to display a text file in a "page through" style

more - puts the contents of a text file directly onto the terminal screen

rmdir  - used to remove directories

rm - used to remove files 

help - displays helpful information about a particular thing
