        <p>Well for starters Margin, Border, and Padding are key:value pairs that are used in CSS, a web design language, to help determine the dimensions of content.</p>
        <p>Before I go into the detailed web design description of the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding let me give you an example: Imagine we are moving a very delicate antique vase that our Depression era grandmother gave us. It is her pride and joy. So obviously we want to be very careful with it. The vase itself represents what we call content in CSS, that could be a paragraph, image, heading etc.. The bubble wrap we put around the vase, to keep it from touching the inside of the box, is representative of the Padding key:value pair in CSS. The box itself is what we would call a border in CSS. It is effectively the end of the extension of our content. We can make the border thin or thick just like we can use a thick wooden box or a thin cardboard box. Lastly, we wouldn’t want to put Nana’s vase near any other heavy items in the moving truck because they could fall on it and smash it. The space separating our box from other boxes represents the Margin key:value pair. That’s a very basic explanation of how Margin, Border, and Padding determine the dimensions of and spaces in-between content in CSS.</p>

  I had a good time pairing with Liam today, and Lorena was a wonderful guide. The HTML5 elements I used and continue to come back to are header, article, section, and footer. The whole idea of these semantic tags is great. It makes it so much easier to organize and understand an HTML page.

  Elements in HTML get laid out on a page from left to right and top to bottom. It's only CSS that can start moving things around in some other way. Liam and I discussed how the browswer displays elements and we think it's an "out to in" type of thing where it looks at the parent/child structure of the HTML and displays that way. It's got to know where the tags start and end and work that way.

  I learned today that Sublime has a wonderful feature called snippets! It's already extremely useful. I had been using a "cheat sheet" that I made to make sure I had all the essential HTML elements. Now I know I can type "HTML5" (our snippet we made today) and have things set up easily. I will definitely make more snippets. It seems absurdly useful. And I will definitely research which snippets already exist.

  Overall it was a really informative GSP! -->
