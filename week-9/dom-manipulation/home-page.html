<!-- Add your reflection here
What did you learn about the DOM?

I knew nothing about the DOM really, before now. This
was a nice introduction. I learned how to conceptualize
it, as well as how to start manipulate it.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

Accessing items by their id, class, or tag is very
useful. After that I can edit text, or CSS elements.
