####What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's purpose is to be a professional website where I can share work history, my blog, and projects.

####What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is fellow DBC students, guides, and eventually potential employers. I hope to engage with all three of these groups in a professional yet personal way. That is to say, I hope my tone comes across as professional but my personality is able to come through. 

####What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I hope that each user's primary action is to search for information about me.

####What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

I think that the most important thing is that though one design may not fit all, websites should be designed with the user in mind. 

####What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

UX design is designing a website or app, keeping in mind how a user will feel when using it. It's making a website pleasant and easy to use.

It can be valuable in a literal sense by making people actually be more likely to purchase something through making an e-commerce site easy to navigate.  Or it could be valuable by making a user feel comfortable so that they stay on the site for a long time, soaking up the information displayed there. 

####Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I honestly didn't find too much of this information tedious.  I've been trying to ask a friend of mine who is a "UX UI designer" what he does for a living for a while and he hasn't articulated it very well.  Now I think I have an idea!
