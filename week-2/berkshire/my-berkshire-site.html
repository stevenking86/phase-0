<!-- I enjoyed translating my studies into an actual site. I had messed with it a bit before, but doing it this way felt better. I am really enjoying the pairing aspect of DBC so far!

  Honestly I think we could've done a better job keeping our code even more clean with proper section headings, indentation, and other HTML5 semantics but I'm happy we came out with a functional website.

  We did good with HTML best practices as far as formatting goes. You won't see any style tags in the above code.

  I like HTML for its simplicity. It's obviously limited though, which is why I'm excited to work with CSS in the coming weeks.

  I don't really have any tricks to remember HTML code. A lot of it is regular English like "span" or "head" and other than that the tags seem sensible, like "p" for paragraph.
