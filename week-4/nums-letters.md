####What does puts do?

It returns nil and prints the output to the console on a new line.

####What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a number without a decimal point. A float is a number with a decimal point.

####What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Float division works more like division on a calculator. 9.0/2.0 will return 4.5. Integer division, however, always returns an integer. So 9/2 will return 4.
