##4.2

####What does puts do?

It returns nil and prints the output to the console on a new line.

####What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a number without a decimal point. A float is a number with a decimal point.

####What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Float division works more like division on a calculator. 9.0/2.0 will return 4.5. Integer division, however, always returns an integer. So 9/2 will return 4.

####Release 2:

Hours in a year:

'''
puts 24*365
'''

Minutes in a decade:

'''
puts 60*24*365*10
'''


####How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

It handles them about like a calculator would! Except that's not entirely true of integer operations. If you do operations with two integers you will always get an integer back.


####What is the difference between integers and floats?

Integers do not have decimal points. Floats do have decimal points.


####What is the difference between integer and float division?

Integer division will always return an integer. Float division will return a float. (This means, if you don't know what's going on, the integer division might look "wrong".)


####What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are basically groups of letters or text. They're really anything separated by these: "" or ''


####What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are variables that have been assigned with a variable name in a program. You use them when you want to store a value that you'll reuse in your program.


####How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

I did get a nice review! It was also nice to work with rspec which I've only done a little bit in the past. It also gave me a chance to start working with the Chris Pine book.
